## Connecting to a database
  - Open the `SRC/` folder
  - Edit the field in `initialization.php` to match your database credentials and database name.
    - **NOTE:** If you are using phpmyadmin all you have to do is add a database that is called animal.
  - Start the server

## Getting started

## As a user, what can I do?
As a user you can:
  - Like animals
  - Adopt animals
